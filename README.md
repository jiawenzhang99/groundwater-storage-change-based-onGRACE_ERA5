Groundwater Storage Changes Based on GRACE and ERA5 Data

This approach assumes that groundwater storage (ΔGW) can be computed by subtracting soil moisture (ΔSM), snow water equivalent (ΔSWE), surface water (ΔSWA), canopy water storage (ΔCWS) from total water storage (ΔTWS), 
as shown in Equation:

ΔGW= ΔTWS- ΔSM - ΔSWE- ΔSWA- ∆CWS
